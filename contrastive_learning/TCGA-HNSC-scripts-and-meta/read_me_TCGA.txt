The TCGA-HNSC data is stored in the folder with that name. the clinical data is stored 
in clinical.project-tcga-hnsc.2024-05-10.json and metadata in metadata.cart.2024-05-10.json.


The metadata file allows you to map data and clinical variables to a patient. 

The folder "TCGA-HNSCA" contains files in sub-folders. The sub-folders have file_id as name. 

Each patient has a case_id, and with the metadata file, you can map data to patient. 

I made patient to svs map in the file "svs_patient_map.json"
